## How it works

The app is running several algorithms to detect facial landmarks, and run sentimental analysis on these. The openFrameworks app delivers these landmark points and sentimental analysis results via JavaScript injection into a local WebView and/or over WebSockets to a remote browser, ready for HTML5 canvas animation.
